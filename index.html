			<span>📖I like philosphy🧓</span>
			<p class="heading">philosophy</p>
			<p class="details">Philosophy is about looking at life and questioning everything about it. I have learned in this course to think about the whys in life and not just passively go through life just as Sophie learned to do in Sophie’s World. In philosophy, love, friendship and wisdom all come together as one can help point out some reasons why the world is as it is.</p>

However, it is when I start imaging blood in my head that I will feel extremely disgusted and uncomfortable😱🩸. So don't try to scare me with actual blood, me no worry. </p>
